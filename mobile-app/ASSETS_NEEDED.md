# Required Assets

The mobile app needs the following image assets. You can create placeholder images or use your own:

## Required Files

Create these files in the `mobile-app/assets/` directory:

1. **icon.png** (1024x1024)
   - App icon for both iOS and Android
   - Should be square with no transparency

2. **splash.png** (1284x2778 recommended)
   - Splash screen image
   - Shown when app is launching

3. **adaptive-icon.png** (1024x1024)
   - Android adaptive icon foreground
   - Should work on various backgrounds

4. **favicon.png** (48x48)
   - Web favicon (if using web version)

## Quick Setup

You can use placeholder images for now:

1. Create a simple colored square (1024x1024) for icon.png
2. Use the same or a different image for splash.png
3. For adaptive-icon.png, use a version that looks good on colored backgrounds

## Note

The app will work without these assets, but you'll see warnings. For production, proper assets are required.
